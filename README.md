# Welcome to Porject Seisan!

Hi! I'm student engineer . My branch is Electronics Communication and Information Engineering. This is the project for first semester using C language. In this project I have tried to recreate  **TODO list** application.


# Files
There are two files :

 **todo.c**: You can find actual code of my application here.
 
 **seisan.exe** This is the application: You can downlad and use it.

# Features

-Very first you can easily create list and add as much as task you want. If you forget to add to important task then you can update the list. List can be  updated serially or hierarchically.

-You can also delete list specifically as well as whole list at once.

-You can keep tracks of works by marking completed works

-Most promising feature is that you can export you todo list in txt file in your system and store it.

# Topics

**Linked list**: In order to store data and execute it, linked list is the best option available.

**Pointers** :Linked list is incomplete without pointers.

**String**:Handling strings is also main part of this project.

**File handling**: File handling helps in exporting list.


note: Description is available.
